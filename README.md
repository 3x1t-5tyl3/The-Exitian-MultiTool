# 3x1t-neos-MT
A bug/request repository for 3x1t_5tyl3's NEOSVR ingame MultiTool for ease of reporting.

For questions ask for 3x1t_5tyl3#0001 on discord.



How to use the tool:

If you happen to find bugs, please report them here on the github with an exact description. (Please spawn out a fresh version out of my PublicFolder before you report it! Even *if it's only a model change*!)
If you have any questions please ask 3x1t_5tyl3 ingame or 3x1t_5tyl3#0001 on Discord.

How to..
.. switch between 2 tools: Double Context menu on your *offhand*
if you're right handed.. use your left. And left handed.. use your right.

.. switch between any tool: Open your context menu and select "Switch Tool". You'll be presented with page 1 of 3 of the tool selection.

.. open settings: Inspect the tool with a DevTip and go to: "Settings" and adjust them to your liking. I reccomend to leave them at default.

DevTip:
The developer Tip includes a custom Inspector. To open it you open your Context-Menu and press "Open DarkMode Inspector".
To add a new tab you can click on "New Tab" or drag and drop a Slot-Reference into it.
To close a tab you doubleclick the colorblock at the front of the Tab.
To open the Clipboard you click on "ClipB"
The inspector also has scrollbars at the left and right. For the slots and the components.
You can click on the Slot or component text at the top to get back to the top of the Slot/component list.
Hold "Grip & Trigger" and then do a "flick" motion to deselect gizmos in a radius around the tool (~ 2m radius).

LogiXTip: (Original by Orange and Rhenium, Edited by Ukilop and 3x1t_5tyl3)
The LogiXTip includes a "LongRange" mode. Use this mode with caution! It's not intended to be used constantly, but more nichely when you actually need to use it.
To enable it Double press secondary.
The LogiXTip also features a Custom NodeMenu. You open and close as per the usual NodeMenu.
To delete a mass of connected nodes you can Click on "Set Void" to set the Tool to "Void" mode. It'll delete everything that's packed with it. So use it with caution.

StylusTip:
To clear strokes you doubleclick "Delete Strokes".
And to bake the strokes you click once on "Bake Strokes"

MaterialTip:
Press secondary to "pick" a material and secondary again after to to store it.
Double Context menu to switch between the stored materials.

ComponentCloneTip:
Click on the available options to select your current one.
At the bottom you see your currently selected Clone.
Press secondary again to add it to the list.
*DO NOT* grab the currently selected Clone. You *WILL* be deleted.
